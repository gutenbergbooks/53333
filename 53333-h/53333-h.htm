<p>Who of us care to be present at the accouchment of the immortal?
I think that we so attend who are first to take this
book in our hands. A bold assertion, truly, and one demonstrable
only in years remote from these; and—dust wages no
war with dust. But it is one of those things that I should most
“like to come back and see.”</p>

<p>Because he has lent himself the more innocently to the whispers
of his subconscious daemon, and because he has set those
murmurs to purer and harder crystal than we others, by so
much the longer will the poems of Clark Ashton Smith endure.
Here indeed is loot against the forays of moth and rust. Here
we shall find none or little of the sentimental fat with which
so much of our literature is larded. Rather shall one in Imagination’s
“misty mid-region,” see elfin rubies burn at his feet,
witch-fires glow in the nearer cypresses, and feel upon his brow
a wind from the unknown. The brave hunters of fly-specks
on Art’s cathedral windows will find little here for their
trouble, and both the stupid and the over-sophisticated would
best stare owlishly and pass by: here are neither kindergartens
nor skyscrapers. But let him who is worthy by reason of his
clear eye and unjaded heart wander across these borders of
beauty and mystery and be glad.</p>

  <div class="verse">No eremite hath lingered there to say,</div>

  <div class="verse">A chuckle sharp as crepitating ice,</div>
  <div class="verse">Upheaved and cloven by shoulders of the damned</div>
  <div class="verse">Who strive in Antenora. When my eyes</div>
  <div class="verse">Undazzle, and the cloud of colour fades,</div>

  <div class="verse">Borne by the wind from pool to sluggish pool</div>
  <div class="verse">In fields where wide Cocytus flows his bound,</div>
  <div class="verse">A crackling smile around that circle runs,</div>

  <div class="verse">With eyes that turn to glowing coals. A fear</div>
  <div class="verse">That found no name in Babel, flings me on,</div>
  <div class="verse">Breathless and faint with horror, to a hall</div>
  <div class="verse">Within whose weary, self-reverting round,</div>
  <div class="verse">The languid curtains, heavier than palls,</div>

  <div class="verse">Who fain would cool his jewel-crusted hands</div>
  <div class="verse">In lakes of emerald evening, or the fields</div>
  <div class="verse">Of dreamless poppies pure with rain. I flee</div>
  <div class="verse">Onward, and all the shadowy curtains shake</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
  <div class="verse">With tremors of a silken-sighing mirth,</div>
  <div class="verse">And whispers of the innumerable king,</div>
  <div class="verse">Breathing a tale of ancient pestilence,</div>
  <div class="verse">Whose very words are vile contagion. Then</div>
  <div class="verse">I reach a room where caryatids,</div>
  <div class="verse">Carved in the form of tall, voluptuous Titan women,</div>
  <div class="verse">Surround a throne of flowering ebony</div>
  <div class="verse">Where creeps a vine of crystal. On the throne,</div>
  <div class="verse">There lolls a wan, enormous Worm, whose bulk,</div>
  <div class="verse">Tumid with all the rottenness of kings,</div>
  <div class="verse">O’erflows its arms with fold on creasèd fold</div>
  <div class="verse">Of fat obscenely bloating. Open-mouthed</div>
  <div class="verse">He leans, and from his throat a score of tongues,</div>
  <div class="verse">Depending like to wreaths of torpid vipers,</div>
  <div class="verse">Drivel with phosphorescent slime, that runs</div>
  <div class="verse">Down all his length of soft and monstrous folds,</div>
  <div class="verse">And creeping among the flow’rs of ebony,</div>
  <div class="verse">Lends them the life of tiny serpents. Now,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ere the Horror ope those red and lashless slits</div>
  <div class="verse">Of eyes that draw the gnat and midge, I turn,</div>
  <div class="verse">And follow down a dusty hall, whose gloom,</div>
  <div class="verse">Lined by the statues with their mighty limbs,</div>
  <div class="verse">Ends in a golden-roofed balcony</div>
  <div class="verse">Sphering the flowered horizon.</div>
  <div class="verse indent28">Ere my heart</div>
  <div class="verse">Hath hushed the panic tumult of its pulses,</div>
  <div class="verse">I listen, from beyond the horizon’s rim,</div>
  <div class="verse">A mutter faint as when the far simoon,</div>

  <div class="verse">And sweep the sands to fury. As the storm,</div>
  <div class="verse">Approaching, mounts and loudens to the ears</div>
  <div class="verse">Of them that toil in fields of sesame,</div>
  <div class="verse">So grows the mutter, and a shadow creeps</div>
  <div class="verse">Above the gold horizon, like a dawn</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>

<p>“Stranger, where goest thou, in the sad raiment of a pilgrim,
with shattered sandals retaining the dust and mire of so many
devious ways! With thy brow that alien suns have darkened,
and thy hair made white from the cold rime of alien moons?
Wanderest thou in search of the cities greater than Rome,
with walls of opal and crystal, and fanes more white than the
summer clouds, or the foam of hyperboreal seas? Or farest
thou to the lands unpeopled and unexplored, to the sunless
deserts lit by the baleful and calamitous beacons of volcanoes?
Or seekest thou an extremer shore, where the red and monstrous
lilies are like a royal pageant, pausing with innumerable
flambeaux held aloft on the verge of the waveless waters?”</p>

<p>“Nay, it is none of these that I seek, but forevermore I
seek the city and the land of my former home: In the quest
thereof I have wandered from the first immemorable years of
my youth till now, and have mingled the dust of many realms,
of many highways, in my garments’ hem. I have seen the cities
greater than Rome, and the fanes more white than the clouds of
summer; the lands unpeopled and unexplored, and the land
that is thronged by the red and monstrous lilies. Even the far,
aerial walls of the cities of mirage, and the saffron meadows of
sunset I have seen, but nevermore the city and land of my former
home.”</p>

<p>“Where lieth the land of thine home? and by what name
shall we know it, and distinguish the rumour thereof, among
the rumours of many lands?”</p>

<p>“Alas! I know not where it lieth; nor in the broad, black
scrolls of geographers, and the charts of old seamen who have
sailed to the marge of the seventh sea, is the place thereof recorded.
And its name I have never learned, howbeit I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
learned the name of empires lying beneath stars to us invisible.
In many languages have I spoken, in barbarous tongues unknown
to Babel; and I have heard the speech of many men,
even of them that inhabit the strange isles of the sea of fire
and the sea of snow. Thunder, and lutes, and battle-drums,
the fine unceasing querulousness of gnats, and the stupendous
moaning of the simoon; lyres of ebony, damascened with crystal,
bells of malachite with golden clappers; the song of exotic
birds that sigh like women or sob like fountains; whispers and
shoutings of fire, the multitudinous mutter of cities asleep,
the manifold tumult of cities at dawn, and the slow and weary
murmur of desert-wandering streams—all, all have I heard,
but never, in any place, from any tongue, a sound or syllable
that resembled in the least the name I would learn.”</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_FLOWER-DEVIL">THE FLOWER-DEVIL</h2>


<p>In a basin of porphyry, at the summit of a pillar of serpentine,
the thing has existed from primeval time, in the garden of the
kings that rule an equatorial realm of the planet Saturn. With
black foliage, fine and intricate as the web of some enormous
spider; with petals of livid rose, and purple like the purple of
putrefying flesh; and a stem rising like a swart and hairy wrist
from a bulb so old, so encrusted with the growth of centuries
that it resembles an urn of stone, the monstrous flower holds
dominion over all the garden. In this flower, from the years
of the oldest legend, an evil demon has dwelt—a demon whose
name and whose nativity are known to the superior magicians
and mysteriarchs of the kingdom, but to none other. Over the
half-animate flowers, the ophidian orchids that coil and sting,
the bat-like lilies that open their ribbèd petals by night, and
fasten with tiny yellow teeth on the bodies of sleeping dragonflies;
the carnivorous cacti that yawn with green lips beneath
their beards of poisonous yellow prickles; the plants that palpitate
like hearts, the blossoms that pant with a breath of venomous
perfume—over all these, the Flower-Devil is supreme,
in its malign immortality, and evil, perverse intelligence—inciting
them to strange maleficence, fantastic mischief, even
to acts of rebellion against the gardeners, who proceed about
their duties with wariness and trepidation, since more than one
of them has been bitten, even unto death, by some vicious and
venefic flower. In places, the garden has run wild from lack
of care on the part of the fearful gardeners, and has become a
monstrous tangle of serpentine creepers, and hydra-headed
plants, convolved and inter-writhing in lethal hate or venomous
love, and horrible as a rout of wrangling vipers and pythons.</p>

<p>And, like his innumerable ancestors before him, the king
dares not destroy the Flower, for fear that the devil, driven
from its habitation, might seek a new home, and enter into the
brain or body of one of the king’s subjects—or even the heart
of his fairest and gentlest, and most beloved queen!</p>

<p>TEARS</p>

<p>Thy tears are not as mine: Thou weepest as a green fountain
among palms and roses, with lightly falling drops that bedew
the flowery turf. My tears are like a rain of marah in the
desert, leaving a bitter pool whose waters are fire and poison.</p>

<p>THE SECRET ROSE</p>

<p>My soul hath dreamt of a rose, whose marvellous and secret
flower, fraught with an unimaginable perfume, hath never
grown in any garden. Only in valleys of the shifting cloud,
only among the palms and fountains of a land of mirage, only
in isles beyond the seas of sunset, it blooms for a moment, and
is gone. But ever the ghost of its fragrance haunts the hall of
slumber; and the women whom I meet in dreams wear always
its blossom for coronal.</p>

<p>THE WIND AND THE GARDEN</p>

<p>To thee my love is something strange and fantastical, and
far away, like the vast and desolate sighing of the desert wind
to one who dwells in a garden of palm and rose and lotus, filled
by no louder sound than the mellow lisp of a breeze of perfume,
or the sigh of silvering fountains.</p>

<p>OFFERINGS</p>

<p>Before thee, O goddess of my dreams, idol of my desires, I
have burnt amber and myrrh, frankincense, and all the strange
and rich perfumes of lands a thousand leagues beyond Araby
or Taprobane. Strange and rich offerings have I brought thee,
the gems of unknown regions, and the spoil of cities remoter
than Caydon or Samarkand. But these delight thee not, only
the simple-scented flowers of spring, and the diamonds and
opals of dew, strung on the threads of the spider.</p>

<p>A CORONAL</p>

<p>The pale and flowerless poppies of Proserpine, the cold,
blind lotus of Lethe, and the strange, white sea-blooms that
grow from the lips of drowned men in the blue darkness of
the nether sea,—these have I woven as a coronal for my dead
love.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_BLACK_LAKE">THE BLACK LAKE</h2>


<p>In a land where weirdness and mystery had strongly leagued
themselves with eternal desolation, the lake was out-poured
at an undiscoverable date of elder aeons, to fill some fathomless
gulf far down amid the shadows of snowless, volcanic
mountains. No eye, not even the sun’s, when he stared vertically
upon it for a few hours at midday, seemed able to divine
its depths of sullen blackness and unrippled silence. It was
for this reason that I found a so singular pleasure in frequently
contemplating the strange lake. Sitting for I knew not how
long on its bleak basaltic shores, where grew but a few fleshly
red orchids, bent above the waters like open and thirsty
mouths, I would peer with countless fantastic conjectures and
shadowy imaginings, into the alluring mystery of its unknown
and inexplorable gulf.</p>

<p>It was at an hour of morning before the sun had surmounted
the rough and broken rim of the summits, when I first came,
and clomb down through the shadows which filled like some
subtler fluid the volcanic basin. Seen at the bottom of that
stirless tincture of air and twilight, the lake seemed as dregs of
darkness.</p>

<p>Peering for the first time, after the deep and difficult
descent, into the so dull and leaden waters, I was at length
aware of certain small and scattered gleams of silver, apparently
far beneath the surface. And fancying them the metal in
some mysterious ledge, or the glints of long-sunken treasure, I
bent closer in my eagerness, and finally perceived that what I
saw was but the reflection of the stars, which, tho the day was
full upon the mountains and the lands without, were yet visible
in the depth and darkness of that enshadowed place.</p>

<p>BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS</p>

<p>Surely, beyond the mountains there is peace—beyond the
mountains that lie so blue and still at the world’s extreme.
Such ancient calm, such infinite quietude is upon them, that
surely, no toiling cities, no sea whose foam a ship has ever
cloven, can lie beyond, but valleys of azure silence, where
amaranthine flowers sleep and dream, untroubled of any wind,
by the hyalescense of tranquilly flowing streams unbroken
as the surface of a mirror.</p>


<p>THE BROKEN LUTE</p>

<p>Because you are silent to my lyric prayers, deaf to the melodies
I have made from the sighs and murmurs of a wounded
love, I have broken my golden lute, and cast it away, tarnished
and unstrung, among the red leaves and faded roses of the
September garden. Silence, the silver dust of lilies, the mournful
muted wind of autumn, and the fitfully drifting leaves,
have claimed it for their own. Seeing it there, as you pass on
your queenly way amid the crumbling roses, will you not echo
in your heart one sigh of the many sighs, which, as a music
for your pleasure, were breathed from its chords, during the
summer’s half-forgotten days?</p>


<p>NOSTALGIA OF THE UNKNOWN</p>

<p>The nostalgia of things unknown, of lands forgotten or unfound,
is upon me at times. Often I long for the gleam of yellow
suns upon terraces of translucent azure marble, mocking
the windless waters of lakes unfathomably calm; for lost,
legendary palaces of serpentine, silver and ebony, whose columns
are green stalactites; for the pillars of fallen temples,
standing in the vast purpureal sunset of a land of lost and
marvellous romance. I sigh for the dark-green depths of cedar
forests, through whose fantastically woven boughs, one sees at
intervals an unknown tropic ocean, like gleams of blue diamond;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
for isles of palm and coral, that fret an amber morning, somewhere
beyond Cathay or Taprobana; for the strange and hidden
cities of the desert, with burning brazen domes and slender
pinnacles of gold and copper, that pierce a heaven of
heated lazuli.</p>


<p>GREY SORROW</p>

<p>Ofttimes, in the golden, sad, November days, I meet among
the dead roses of the garden the ghost of an old sorrow—a sorrow
grey and dim as the mist of autumn—as a wandering mist
that was once a rain of tears. There, through the long decline
of afternoon, I walk among the roses with the ghost of my
sorrow, whose half-forgotten, half-invisible form becomes dimmer
and more indistinct, till I know its face no longer from the
twilight, nor its voice from the vesper wind.</p>


<p>THE HAIR OF CIRCE</p>

<p>I am afraid of thy hair: Lustrous, heavily curled, it suggests
the coils of a golden snake; and half the fascination of
thy painted lips, of thy still and purple-lidded eyes, is due to
the fear that it may awake beneath my caresses.</p>


<p>THE EYES OF CIRCE</p>

<p>Thine eyes are green and still as the lakes of the desert.
They awake in me the thirst for strange and bitter mysteries,
the desire of secrets that are deadly and sterile.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="A_DREAM_OF_LETHE">A DREAM OF LETHE</h2>


<p>In the quest of her whom I had lost, I came at length to the
shores of Lethe, under the vault of an immense, empty, ebon
sky, from which all the stars had vanished one by one. Proceeding
I knew not whence, a pale, elusive light as of the waning
moon, or the phantasmal phosphorescence of a dead sun,
lay dimly and without lustre on the sable stream, and on the
black, flowerless meadows. By this light, I saw many wandering
souls of men and women, who came, hesitantly or in haste,
to drink of the slow unmurmuring waters. But among all
these, there were none who departed in haste, and many who
stayed to watch, with unseeing eyes, the calm and waveless
movement of the stream. At length in the lily-tall and gracile
form, and the still, uplifted face of a woman who stood
apart from the rest, I saw the one whom I had sought; and,
hastening to her side, with a heart wherein old memories sang
like a nest of nightingales, was fain to take her by the hand.
But in the pale, immutable eyes, and wan, unmoving lips that
were raised to mine, I saw no light of memory, nor any tremor
of recognition. And knowing now that she had forgotten, I
turned away despairingly, and finding the river at my side,
was suddenly aware of my ancient thirst for its waters, a thirst
I had once thought to satisfy at many diverse springs, but in
vain. Stooping hastily, I drank, and rising again, perceived
that the light had died or disappeared, and that all the land
was like the land of a dreamless slumber, wherein I could no
longer distinguish the faces of my companions. Nor was I
able to remember any longer why I had wished to drink of the
waters of oblivion.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_CARAVAN">THE CARAVAN</h2>


<p>My dreams are like a caravan that departed long ago, with
tumult of intrepid banners and spears, and the clamour of
bugles and brave adventurous songs, to seek the horizons of
perilous untried barbaric lands, and kingdoms immense and
vaguely rumoured, with cities beautiful and opulent as the
cities of paradise, and deep Edenic vales of palm and cinnamon
and myrrh, lying beneath skies of primeval azure silence. For
traffic in the realms of mystery and wonder, in the marts of
scarce-imaginable cities and metropoli a million leagues
away, on the last horizon of romance, my dreams departed,
as a caravan with its laden camels. Since then, the years are
many, the days have flown as the flocks of southering swallows;
unnumbered moons have multiplied in fugitive silver,
uncounted suns in irretainable gold. But, alas, my dreams have
not returned. Have the swirling sands engulfed them, on a
noon of storm when the desert rose like a sea, and rolled its
tawny billows on the walled gardens of the green and fragrant
lands? Or perished they, devoured by the crimson demons of
thirst, and the ghouls and vultures? Or live they still, as captives
in alien dungeons not to be ascertained, or held by a wizard
spell in palaces demon-built, and cities baroque and splendid
as the cities in a tale from the Thousand and One Nights?</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_PRINCESS_ALMEENA">THE PRINCESS ALMEENA</h2>


<p>From her balcony of pearl the princess Almeena, clad in a
gown of irisated silk, with her long and sable locks unbound,
gazes toward the sunset-flooded sea beyond a terrace of green
marble that peacocks guard. Below, in the tinted light, fantastic
trees whose boles are serpentine, train a fine and hair-like
foliage, mingling with the moon-shaped leaves of enormous
lilies. Rainbow-coloured reeds cluster about the pools and
fountains of black water, that are rimmed with carven malachite.
But these the princess does not heed, but gazes upon
the far-off seas, where the golden ichors of the sun have gathered
in a vast lake overflowing the horizon. Ere long, a wind
from the west, from islands where palm trees blossom above the
purple foam, brings in its breath the odour of unknown flowers
to mingle with the balms of the garden, and the sweet suspiration
of the princess—the princess who dreams, listening to the
wind, that her lover, the captain of the emperor’s most redoubtable
trireme of war, sailing the sky-blue seas beyond the
horizon and the sunset, has remembered her wild and royal
loveliness, and has breathed in his heart a secret sigh.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="ENNUI">ENNUI</h2>


<p>In the alcove whose curtains are cloth-of-gold, and whose
pillars are fluted sapphire, reclines the emperor Chan, on
his couch of ebony set with opals and rubies, and cushioned with
the furs of unknown and gorgeous beasts. With implacable
and weary gaze, from beneath unmoving lids that seem carven
of purple-veined onyx, he stares at the crystal windows, giving
upon the infinite fiery azures of a tropic sky and sea.
Oppressive as nightmare, a formless, nameless fatigue, heavier
than any burden the slaves of the mines must bear, lies forever
at his heart: All deliriums of love and wine, the agonizing
ecstasy of drugs, even the deepest and the faintest pulse of
delight or pain—all are proven, all are futile, for the outworn
but insatiate emperor. Even for a new grief, or a subtler pang
than any felt before, he thinks, lying on his bed of ebony,
that he would give the silver and vermilion of all his mines,
with the crowded caskets, the carcanets and crowns that lie
in his most immemorial treasure-vault. Vainly, with the verse
of the most inventive poets, the fanciful purple-threaded fabrics
of the subtlest looms, the unfamiliar gems and minerals
from the uttermost land, the pallid leaves and blood-like petals
of a rare and venomous blossom—vainly, with all these, and
many stranger devices, wilder, more wonderful diversions, the
slaves and sultanas have sought to alleviate the iron hours.
One by one he has dismissed them with a weary gesture. And
now, in the silence of the heavily curtained alcove, he lies alone,
with the canker of ennui at his heart, like the undying mordant
worm at the heart of the dead.</p>

<p>Anon, from between the curtains at the head of his couch, a
dark and slender hand is slowly extended, clasping a dagger
whose blade reflects the gold of the curtain in a thin and
stealthily wavering gleam: Slowly, in silence, the dagger is
poised, then rises and falls like a splinter of lightning. The
emperor cries out, as the blade, piercing his loosely folded robe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
wounds him slightly in the side. In a moment the alcove is
filled with armed attendants, who seize and drag forth the
would-be assassin—a slave girl, the princess of a conquered
people, who has often, but vainly, implored her freedom from
the emperor. Pale and panting with terror and rage, she faces
Chan and the guardsmen, while stories of unimaginable monstrous
tortures, of dooms unnameable, crowd upon her memory.
But Chan, aroused and startled only for the instant, feels again
the insuperable weariness, more strong than anger or fear, and
delays to give the expected signal. And then, momentarily
moved, perchance, by some ironical emotion, half-akin to gratitude—gratitude
for the brief but diverting danger, which has
served to alleviate his ennui for a little, he bids them free the
princess; and, with a regal courtesy, places about her throat
his own necklace of pearls and emeralds, each of which is the
cost of an army.</p>

And she answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> “The name of it is Silence, but neither god

The seraphim pause often before it, waiting the day when the

surprise me, like the monstrous orchids of unknown colour,
blossoming in planets beyond Aldebaran. And I am startled by
the yellow and purple leaves of October, as if the veil of some
tremendous and awful mystery were half-withdrawn for a moment.
In such hours as these, O heart of my heart, I fear to
touch thee, I avoid thy caresses, dreading that thou wilt vanish
as a dream at dawn; or that I shall find thee a phantom, the
spectre of one who died and was forgotten many thousand

<p>Ringed with a bronze horizon, which, at a point immensely
remote, seems welded with the blue brilliance of a sky of steel,
they oppose the black splendour of their porphyritic forms to
the sun’s insuperable gaze. Reared in the morning twilight of
primeval time, by a race whose towering tombs and cities are
one with the dust of their builders in the slow lapse of the
desert, they abide to face the terrible latter dawns, that move
abroad in a starkness of fire, consuming the veils of night on
the vast and Sphinx-like desolations. Level with the light,
their tenebrific brows preserve a pride as of Titan kings. In
their lidless implacable eyes of staring stone, is the petrified
despair of those who have gazed too long on the infinite.</p>

<p>Mute as the mountains from whose iron matrix they were
hewn, their mouths have never acknowledged the sovereignty
of the suns, that pass in triumphal flame from horizon unto
horizon of the prostrate land. Only at eve, when the west is
like a brazen furnace, and the far-off mountains smoulder like
ruddy gold in the depth of the heated heavens—only at eve,
when the east grows infinite and vague, and the shadows of
the waste are one with the increasing shadow of night—then,
and then only, from the sullen throats of stone, a music rings
to the bronze horizon—a strong, a sombre music, strange and
sonorous, like the singing of black stars, or a litany of gods
that invoke oblivion; a music that thrills the desert to its heart
of adamant, and trembles in the granite of forgotten tombs,
till the last echoes of its jubilation, terrible as the trumpets of
doom, are one with the black silence of infinity.</p>

of Satan; like the paler lilies of paradise, or the amaranths
on whose perfect and immortal beauty the seraphim so often
ponder; flowers fierce and splendid like the crimson or golden
flowers of fire; flowers bright and cold as the crystal flowers
of snow; flowers whereof there is no likeness in any world of
any sun; which have no symbol in heaven or in hell.</p>

<p>Alas! in the heart of the garden is a tomb—a tomb so trellised
and embowered with vine and blossom, that the sunlight reveals
the ghastly gleam of its marble to no careless or incurious
scrutiny. But in the night, when all the flowers are still, and
their perfumes are faint as the breathing of children in slumber—then,
and then only, the serpents bred of corruption crawl

abiding-place from end to end of the garden.</p>

<p>It was a windless afternoon of April, beneath skies that were

to seek the fabulous and fortunate realm of Cocaigne. Past
leafing oaks with foliage of bronze and chrysolite, through
zones of yellow and white and red and purple flowers, like a
landscape seen through a prism, we fared with hopeful and
tremulous hearts, forgetting all save the dream we had cherished.***
At last we came to the lonely woods, the pines with
their depth of balmy, cool, compassionate shadow, which are
sacred to the genius of that land. There, for the first time I
was bold to take your hand in mine, and led you to a slope
where the woodland lilies, with petals of white and yellow
ivory, gleamed among the fallen needles. As in a dream, I
found that my arms were about you, as in a dream I kissed
your yielding lips, and the ardent pallor of your cheeks and
throat. Motionless, you clung to me, and a flush arose beneath
my kisses like a delicate stain, and lingered softly. Your eyes
deepened to my gaze like the brown pools of the forest at evening,
and far within them, as in immensity itself, trembled and
<a id="shone"></a>shone the steadfast stars of your love. As a ship that has wandered
beneath stormy suns and disastrous moons, but comes at
last to the arms of the shielding harbour, my head lay on the
gentle heaving of your delicious breast, and I knew that we
had found Cocaigne.</p>

see from our couch of ivory and satin the rising of unknown
stars and perished planets.*** Perhaps we will not return, but
will follow the tropic summer from isle to halcyon isle, across
the amaranthine seas of myth and fable: We will eat the lotos,
and the fruit of lands whereof Odysseus never dreamt; and
drink the pallid wines of faery, grown in a vale of perpetual
moonlight. I will find for you a necklace of rosy-tinted pearls,
and a necklace of yellow rubies, and crown you with precious
corals that have the semblance of sanguine-coloured blossoms.
We will roam in the marts of forgotten cities of jasper, and
carnelian-builded ports beyond Cathay; and I will buy you a
gown of peacock azure damascened with copper and gold and
vermilion; and a gown of black samite with runes of orange,
woven by fantastic sorcery without the touch of hands, in a
dim land of spells and philtres.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="FROM_THE_CRYPTS_OF_MEMORY">FROM THE CRYPTS OF MEMORY</h2>


<p>Aeons of aeons ago, in an epoch whose marvelous worlds
have crumbled, and whose mighty suns are less than shadow,
I dwelt in a star whose course, decadent from the high, irremeable
heavens of the past, was even then verging upon the abyss
in which, said astronomers, its immemorial cycle should find
a dark and disastrous close.</p>

<p>Ah, strange was that gulf-forgotten star—how stranger than
any dream of dreamers in the spheres of to-day, or than any
vision that hath soared upon visionaries, in their retrospection
of the sidereal past! There, through cycles of a history whose
piled and bronze-writ records were hopeless of tabulation, the
dead had come to outnumber infinitely the living. And built
of a stone that was indestructible save in the furnace of suns,
their cities rose beside those of the living like the prodigious
metropli of Titans, with walls that overgloom the vicinal villages.
And over all was the black funereal vault of the cryptic
heavens—a dome of infinite shadows, where the dismal sun,
suspended like a sole, enormous lamp, failed to illumine, and
drawing back its fires from the face of the irresolvable ether,
threw a baffled and despairing beam on the vague remote
horizons, and shrouded vistas illimitable of the visionary land.</p>

<p>We were a sombre, secret, many-sorrowed people—we who
dwelt beneath that sky of eternal twilight, pierced by the
towering tombs and obelisks of the past. In our blood was the
chill of the ancient night of time; and our pulses flagged with
a creeping prescience of the lentor of Lethe. Over our courts
and fields, like invisible sluggish vampires born of mausoleums,
rose and hovered the black hours, with wings that distilled
a malefic languor made from the shadowy woe and
despair of perished cycles. The very skies were fraught with
oppression, and we breathed beneath them as in a sepulcher,
forever sealed with all its stagnancies of corruption and slow
decay, and darkness impenetrable save to the fretting worm.</p>

<p>Vaguely we lived, and loved as in dreams—the dim and mys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>tic
dreams that hover upon the verge of fathomless sleep. We
felt for our women, with their pale and spectral beauty, the
same desire that the dead may feel for the phantom lilies of
Hadean meads. Our days were spent in roaming through the
ruins of lone and immemorial cities, whose palaces of fretted
copper, and streets that ran between lines of carven golden
obelisks, lay dim and ghastly with the dead light, or were
drowned forever in seas of stagnant shadow; cities whose vast
and iron-builded fanes preserved their gloom of primordial
mystery and awe, from which the simulacra of century-forgotten
gods looked forth with unalterable eyes to the hopeless
heavens, and saw the ulterior night, the ultimate oblivion.
Languidly we kept our gardens, whose grey lilies concealed a
necromantic perfume, that had power to evoke for us the dead
and spectral dreams of the past. Or, wandering through ashen
fields of perennial autumn, we sought the rare and mystic immorteles,
with sombre leaves and pallid petals, that bloomed
beneath willows of wan and veil like foliage: or wept with a
sweet and nepenthe-laden dew by the flowing silence of Acherontic
waters.</p>

<p>And one by one we died and were lost in the dust of accumulated
time. We knew the years as a passing of shadows, and
death itself as the yielding of twilight unto night.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="A_PHANTASY">A PHANTASY</h2>


<p>I have dreamt of an unknown land—a land remote in ulterior
time, and alien space not ascertainable: the desert of a
long-completed past, upon which has settled the bleak, irrevocable
silence of infinitude; where all is ruined save the stone
of tombs and cenotaphs; and where the sole peoples are the
kingless, uncounted tribes of the subterranean dead.</p>

<p>Above this land of my dream, citied with tombs and cenotaphs,
a red and smouldering sun maintains a spectral day, in
alternation with an ashen moon through the black ether where
the stars have long since perished. And through the hush of
the consummation of time, above the riven monuments and
crumbled records of alien history, flit in the final twilight the
mysterious wings of seraphim, sent to <a id="fulfill"></a>fulfill ineffable errands,
or confer with demons of the abyss; and black, gigantic angels,
newly returned from missions of destruction, pause amid the
sepulchers to sift from their gloomy and tremendous vans the
pale ashes of annihilated stars.</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_DEMON_THE_ANGEL_AND_BEAUTY">THE DEMON, THE ANGEL, AND BEAUTY</h2>


<p>Of the Demon who standeth or walketh always with me at my
left hand, I asked: “Hast thou seen Beauty? Her that me-seemeth
was the mistress of my soul in Eternity? Her that is
now beyond question set over me in Time; even though I behold
her not, and, it may be, have never beheld, nor ever shall; her
of whose aspect I am ignorant as noon is concerning any star;
her of whom as witness and testimony, I have found only the
hem of her shadow, or at most, her reflection in a dim and
troubled water. Answer, if thou canst, and tell me, is she
like pearls, or like stars? Does she resemble most the sunlight
that is transparent and unbroken, or the sunlight divided into
splendour and iris? Is she the heart of the day, or the soul of
the night?”</p>

<p>To which the Demon answered, after, as I thought, a brief
space of meditation:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>
<p>“Concerning this Beauty, I can tell thee but little beyond
that which thou knowest. Albeit, in those orbs to which the
demons of my rank have admission, there be greater adumbrations
of some transcendent Mystery than here, yet have I
never seen that Mystery itself, and know not if it be male or
female. Aeons ago, when I was young and incautious, when
the world was new and bright, and there were more stars than
now, I, too was attracted by this Mystery, and sought after it
in all accessible spheres. But failing to find the thing itself, I
soon grew weary of embracing its shadows, and took to the
pursuit of illusions less insubstantial. Now I am become grey
and ashen without, and red like old fire within, who was fiery
and flame-coloured all through, back in the star-thronged aeons
of which I speak: Heed me, for I am as wise, and wary and
ancient as the far-travelled and comet-scarred sun; and I am
become of the opinion that the thing Beauty itself does not
exist. Doubtless the semblance thereof is but a web of shadow
and delusion, woven by the crafty hand of God, that He may
snare demons and men therewith, for His mirth, and the laughter
of His archangels.”</p>

<p>The Demon ceased, and took to watching me as usual—obliquely,
and with one eye—an eye that is more red than
Aldebaran, and inscrutable as the gulfs beyond the Hyades.</p>

<p>Then of the Angel, who walketh or standeth always with
me at my right hand, I asked, “Hast thou seen Beauty? Or
hast thou heard any assured rumour concerning Beauty?”</p>

<p>To which the Angel answered, after, as I thought, a moment
of hesitation:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>
<p>“As to this Beauty, I can tell thee but little beyond that
which thou knowest. Albeit in all the heavens, this Mystery
is a topic of the most frequent and sublime speculation among
the archangels, and a perennial theme for the more inspired
singers and harpists of the cherubim—yea, despite all this, we
are greatly ignorant as to its true nature, and substance, and
attributes. But sometimes there are mighty adumbrations
which cover even the superior seraphim from above their
wing-tips, and make unfamiliar twilight in heaven. And sometimes
there is an echo which fills the empyrean, and hushes the
archangelic harps in the midst of their praising of God. This
is not often, and these visitations of echo and shadow spread
an awe over the assembled Thrones and Splendours and Dominations,
which at other times accompanies only the emanence
or appearance of God Himself. Thus are we assured as to the
reality of this Beauty. And because it remains a mystery to
us, to whom naught else is mysterious except God, we conjecture
that it is the thing upon which God meditateth, self-obscured
and centred, and because of which He hath held
himself immanifest to us for so many aeons; that this is the
secret which God keepeth even from the seraphim.”</p>

<h2 class="prose" id="THE_SHADOWS">THE SHADOWS</h2>


<p>There were many shadows in the palace of <a id="Augusthes"></a>Augusthes. About
the silver throne that had blackened beneath the invisible
passing of ages, they fell from pillar and broken roof and
fretted window in ever-shifting multiformity. Seeming the
black, fantastic spectres of doom and desolation, they moved
through the palace in a gradual, grave, and imperceptible
dance, whose music was the change and motion of suns and
moons. They were long and slender, like all other shadows
before the early light, and behind the declining sun; squat
and intense beneath the desert noontide, and faint with the
withered moon; and in the interlunar darkness, they were as
myriad tongues hidden behind the shut and silent lips of night.</p>

<p>One came daily to that place of shadows and desolation, and
sate upon the silver throne, watching the shadows that were
of desolation. King nor slave disputed him there, in the palace
whose kings and whose slaves were powerless alike in the
intangible dungeon of centuries. The tombs of unnumbered
and forgotten monarchs were white upon the yellow desert
roundabout. Some had partly rotted away, and showed like
the sunken eye-sockets of a skull—blank and lidless beneath
the staring heavens; others still retained the undesecrated
seal of death, and were as the closed eyes of one lately dead.
But he who watched the shadows from the silver throne,
heeded not these, nor the fleet wind that dipt to the broken
tombs, and emerged shrilly, its unseen hands dark with the
dust of kings.</p>

<p>He was a philosopher, from what land there was none to
know or ask. Nor was there any to ask what knowledge or
delight he sought in the ruined palace, with eyes alway upon
the moving shadows; nor what were the thoughts that moved
through his mind in ghostly unison with them. His eyes were
old and sad with meditation and wisdom; and his beard was
long and white upon his long white robe.</p>

<p>For many days he came with the dawn and departed with
sunset; and his shadow leaned from the shadow of the throne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
and moved with the others. But one eve he departed not; and
thereafter his shadow was one with the shadow of the silver
throne. Death found and left him there, where he dwindled
into dust that was as the dust of slaves or kings.</p>

<p>But the ebb and refluence of shadows went on, in the days
that were before the end; ere the aged world, astray with the
sun in strange heavens, should be lost in the cosmic darkness,
or, under the influence of other and conflicting gravitations,
should crumble apart and bare its granite bones to the light
of strange suns, and the granite, too, should dissolve, and be
as of the dust of slaves and kings. Noon was encircled with
darkness, and the depths of palace-dusk were chasmed with sunlight.
Change there was none, other than this, for the earth
was dead, and stirred not to the tottering feet of time. And in
the expectant silence before the twilight of the sun, the moving
shadows seemed but a mockery of change; a meaningless antic
phantasmagoria of things that were; an afterfiguring of forgotten
time.</p>

<p>And now the sun was darkened slowly in mid-heaven, as by
some vast and invisible bulk. And twilight hushed the shadows
in the palace of Augusthes, as the world itself swung down
toward the long and single shadow of irretrievable oblivion.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
